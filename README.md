# kludgyKrawler v1.0
a web crawler... that stumbles more than it crawls 

this first version of kludgyKrawler which debuted @ [BitBash 2016](https://vine.co/v/5hK1XjEdKAA) in Chicago was a Firefox addon made w/the old Firefox addon SDK. that SDK has since been depreciated && our addon died along w/it :(

...but we've refactored the code into a standalone application! [checkout the master branch on this repo](https://github.com/nbriz/kludgykrawler)
